# 🌟 CareInsight: Yomna Ali's AI Models Contribution

This repository is strictly focused on my individual work as an AI/Deep Learning Developer for the group graduation project, CareInsight (New Mansoura University). This work contributes to an integrated platform for personalized cancer diagnosis and treatment.

## 📂 Repository Structure:
The core AI scripts are organized into dedicated folders based on the model:
* `1_Brain_Model`
* `2_Breast_Model`
* `3_Skin_Model`

## 🎯 Key AI Contributions:

| Model | Technique Used | Performance & Achievement | Primary Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Brain Tumor Classification** | VGG16 (Fine-Tuning) | **97.56% Accuracy** | Applied advanced fine-tuning and optimization techniques to significantly raise the model's accuracy. |
| **Breast Cancer Classification** | InceptionResNetV2 + CBAM | **91.15% Accuracy** | Contributed to the diagnostic model development, integrating the CBAM attention mechanism. |
| **Skin Cancer Classification** | Deep Neural Network (DL Architecture) | **Full Training Code** | Led the data pre-processing phase and wrote the core training script (available in `3_Skin_Model/skin code.ipynb`). |

### ⚠️ Technical Note: Large File Restriction

Due to GitHub's file size limit (max 25MB for direct upload), the large, compiled model files (e.g., `*.tflite` and `*.keras`) have been omitted from this repository.

**For Verification:** The complete training and conversion scripts are provided, serving as evidence for the stated performance achievements.
