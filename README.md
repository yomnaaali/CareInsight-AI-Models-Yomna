# 🌟 CareInsight: Yomna Ali's AI Models Contribution

This repository is strictly focused on my individual work as an AI/Deep Learning Developer for the group graduation project, CareInsight (New Mansoura University). This work contributes to an integrated platform for personalized cancer diagnosis and treatment.

## 📂 Repository Structure:
The core AI scripts are organized into dedicated folders based on the model:
* `1_Brain_Model`
* `2_Breast_Model`
* `3_Skin_Model`

## 🎯 Key AI Contributions:

| Model | Technique Used | Performance & Achievement | Primary Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Brain Tumor Classification** | VGG16 with Fine-Tuning, Hyperparameter Optimization | **97.56% Accuracy** | Applied Fine-Tuning and revised augmentation/learning rate settings to significantly boost performance from 93% to **97.56%**. |
| **Breast Cancer Classification** | InceptionResNetV2 + CBAM (Attention Module) | **91.15% Accuracy** | Designed the architecture using InceptionResNetV2 and integrated CBAM to enhance focus on histopathology details, achieving **91.15%**. |
| **Skin Cancer Classification** | EfficientNetB2, Data Augmentation & Class Imbalance Handling | **88.42% Accuracy** | Focused on data quality (organizing classes, augmentation) and model stability with EfficientNetB2, achieving **88.42%**. |

### ⚠️ Technical Note: Large File Restriction

Due to GitHub's file size limit (max 25MB for direct upload), the large, compiled model files (e.g., `*.tflite` and `*.keras`) have been omitted from this repository.

**For Verification:** The complete training and conversion scripts are provided, serving as evidence for the stated performance achievements.
